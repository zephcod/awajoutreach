        Following up on my last note — one thing I should have led with: a local retail client
        of ours went from ~5 inquiries a week to 30+ in two months, purely from restructured
        social content and a small ad budget spent properly.

      <P>
        I’d be happy to walk you through exactly what we did and whether the same playbook fits{" "}
        {company}. Would Tuesday or Thursday afternoon work for a quick call?
      </P>
      <P>
        Best,
        <br />
